# General
This repo is private until the completion of our university class. Afterwards it will be transfered to the organisation MathPhysInfo as a FOSS.

## Development
### Frontend
Switch into the frontend directory and run
```
npm i
npm run generate
npm run dev
```
the frontend will be hosted on the first available
port starting at 3000. Note that the backend is not wired
in yet and thus does not serve an actual API to the next app

## Deployment
To be added
