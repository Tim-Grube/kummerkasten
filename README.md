<h3 align="center">Kummerkasten</h3>
<p align="center">A software to collect feedback in educational groups and institutions</p>

</div>

## Getting Started
>[!CAUTION]
> The software is currently only available in german but we are working on implementing general i8n

### Deployment with docker-compose
The software is best deployed in a dockerized environment. We provide `docker-compose.example.yml` as a plug and play file,
which can be used to quickly deploy the software via:
```
docker compose up -d
```
The example file can be found in `/docs`

|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-------------------|
| `POSTGRES_USER`     | User which the database connects with                                        | -       | `kummer`          |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | Password of the postgres user                                                | -       | -                 |
| `POSTGRES_HOST`     | Host of the database, for docker-compose deployments, use the container name | -       | `postgres`        |
| `POSTGRES_PORT`     | Postgres-DB Port                                                             | -       | `5432`            |
| `POSTGRES_DB`       | Name of the database                                                         | -       | `kummerkasten`    |
| `ENV`               | Mode of environment, either `PROD` or `DEV`                                  | `PROD`  | `DEV`             |
| `PEPPER`            | Optional pepper for password hashing                                         | -       | -                 |

>[!CAUTION]
> Changing the Pepper value after already having users will inevitably corrupt the hashing and make it impossible to authenticate. 
> Changing it back will fix already existing hashes but will in turn corrupt new ones again.


## Development
### Frontend
Switch into the frontend directory and run
```
npm i
npm run generate
npm run dev
```
### Backend
After installing general golang and dependencies run

```bash
cp .env .env.local
```

and fill out the configurations as desired. Afterwards run:

```bash
cd server
export $(cat ../.env.local)
docker compose up -d
go generate ./...
go run server.go
```

now the frontend and api are available at port `8080`

### Testing
We provide E2E tests in `frontend/cypress`, to use them run
```bash
cd frontend
npm run test
```
